# Task1: Neural Network from Scratch

## Description
This task implements a fully connected neural network (single hidden layer) for regression using only NumPy.
It includes:
- Forward pass
- Backward pass
- Mean Squared Error loss
- Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer

## Files
- `model.py` : Defines network layers, activations, and loss
- `train.py` : Generates data, trains the network, and plots results

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python and NumPy are installed.
2. Open a terminal in this folder.
3. Run:
   python train.py
4. You will see:
   - Loss curve plot
   - Predicted vs True scatter plot
